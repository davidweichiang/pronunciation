This sheet describes how to pronounce Chinese names and words when they are written using the standard Pinyin system (used by mainland Chinese) and when you are speaking American English.

1. Easy consonants. The letters **b p m f d t n l g k h r s w y** should be pronounced as in English. So should the consonant cluster **ng** at the end of a word.

2. Tricky consonants. These are the most important ones to remember.

| letter     | sound                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **j- zh-** | /dʒ/, like j in Jack, never /ʒ/ as in Jacques! |
| **q- ch-** | /tʃ/, like ch                                  |
| **x- sh-** | /ʃ/, like sh                                   |
| **z-**     | /dz/                                           |
| **c-**     | /ts/                                           |

3. The following vowels can occur before another vowel. When they do, try to pronounce them smoothly, not as an extra syllable.

| letter      | sound                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **-i-**     | /j/, same as English y                                         |
| **-u-**     | /w/                                                            |
| **-ü- -v-** | /y/, like French/German ü; if you can't make this sound, say w |

4. The letter **a** is like in Spanish/French/German, but in English, it changes its sound depending on what comes after it.

| combination | sound           |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **-a**      | /ɑ/ ah          |
| **-an**     | /æn/ Anne       |
| **-ang**    | /æŋ/ as in bang |
| **-ai**     | /aɪ/ aye        |
| **-ao**     | /aʊ/ ow         |

Exceptions:

| combination | sound           |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **yan**     | yen             |
| **-ian**    | yen             |
| **juan**    | jwen            |
| **quan**    | chwen           |
| **xuan**    | shwen           |

5. The letter **e** is hard to approximate in English. These seem to be the most common pronunciations:

| combination | sound                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **-e**      | /ʌ/ as in uh, never a long ee sound |
| **-en**     | /ɛn/ en                             |
| **-eng**    | /ɛŋ/ eng                            |
| **-ei**     | /eɪ/ as in hey                      |
| **ye -ie**  | /yɛ/ as in yet                      |
| **-ue**     | /wɛ/ as in wet                      |

6. The letter **o**, when used by itself, is actually shorthand for **uo**.

| combination | sound                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **-o**      | /wo/ woe                            |
| **-ong**    | /ɔŋ/ as in long                     |
| **-ou**     | /oʊ/ oh                             |

7. The letter **i** is usually pronounced /i/, as in beet. 

But after one of the letters in the second column of #2 above, it is silent! 

| combination | sound            |
|-------------|------------------|
| **zhi**     | jjj, never jee   |
| **chi**     | chhh, never chee |
| **shi**     | shhh, never she  |
| **zi**      | dzzz, never zee  |
| **ci**      | tsss             |
| **si**      | sss, never see   |

8. The letter **u** is usually pronounced /u/, as in boot. But in certain combinations, it is actually shorthand:

| combination | short for | sound            |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **-ui**     | **-uei**  | /weɪ/ way        |
| **-un**     | **-uen**  | /wɛn/ as in Owen |
| **-iu**     | **-iou**  | /yoʊ/ yo         |

And when it appears after one of the letters in the first column of #2 above (**ju qu xu yu**), it is actually shorthand for **ü**.

This sheet describes how to pronounce Chinese names and words when they are written using the standard Pinyin system and when _you are speaking American English_.

## Consonants

1. Easy consonants. The letters **b p m f d t n l s j ch sh r g k h ng y w** should be pronounced as in English.

- Note that **j** should be pronounced exactly as in English: /dʒ/ as in Jack, never /ʒ/ as in Jacques!

2. Tricky consonants. These are the most important ones to remember.

   | letter  | sound                                     |
   |---------|-------------------------------------------|
   | **zh**  | /dʒ/ as in Jack, never /ʒ/ as in Jacques! |
   | **q**   | /tʃ/, exactly like ch                     |
   | **x**   | /ʃ/, exactly like sh                      |
   | **z**   | /dz/                                      |
   | **c**   | /ts/                                      |

- If you can't pronounce **z** as /dz/, then the next best thing is probably to pronounce it as /z/.
- If you can't pronounce **c** as /ts/, then the next best thing is probably to pronounce it as /s/ (never as a hard /k/).

## Vowels

3. Glides. The following vowels can occur between a consonant and another vowel. When they do, try to pronounce them smoothly, not as an extra syllable. 

   | letter      | sound                     |
   |-------------|---------------------------|
   | **i**       | /j/, same as English y    |
   | **u**       | /w/                       |
   | **ü** **v** | /ɥ/, like French/German ü |

- **v** is just another way of writing **ü**.
- If you can't pronounce **ü** as the French/German ü sound, the next best thing is probably to pronounce it /w/, same as **u**.

3a. If a word has an apostrophe in it, like **Xi'an**, that means it _should_ be pronounced as two syllables.

4. The letter **a** is pronounced /a/, as in many languages, like Spanish or French, but in English, it changes its sound depending on context. Below are all the possible endings that can come after **a**, and their most common pronunciations in English:

   | letter(s) | sound           |
   |-----------|-----------------|
   | **-a**    | /ɑ/ ah          |
   | **-an**   | /æn/ Anne       |
   | **-ang**  | /æŋ/ as in bang |
   | **-ai**   | /aɪ/ aye        |
   | **-ao**   | /aʊ/ ow         |

4a. Exception: **-an** preceded by **i** **y** or **ü** changes to /ɛ/; this interacts with rule 8b below, so it's easier to write out the possibilities:

   | letters  | sound |
   |----------|-------|
   | **yan**  | yen   |
   | **-ian** | yen   |
   | **juan** | jwen  |
   | **quan** | chwen |
   | **xuan** | shwen |

5. The letter **e** has two sounds.

5a. Usually it's pronounced /ɤ/, but this sound does not exist in English, so:

   | letter(s) | sound                             |
   |-----------|-----------------------------------|
   | **-e**    | /ʌ/ as in huh, never /i/ as in he |
   | **-en**   | /ɛn/ en                           |
   | **-eng**  | /ɛŋ/ eng                          |
   
5b. When preceded by **i** **y** or **ü**, it's pronounced /ɛ/.

   | letters    | sound          |
   |------------|----------------|
   | **-ei**    | /eɪ/ as in hey |
   | **ye -ie** | /jɛ/ as in yet |
   | **-ue**    | /wɛ/ as in wet |
   | **-üe**    | /ɥɛ/ as in wet |

6. The letter **o**

   | letter(s) | sound           |
   |-----------|-----------------|
   | **-ong**  | /ʊŋ/            |
   | **-ou**   | /oʊ/ oh, not oo |

6a. When **-o** is used by itself, it's actually shorthand for **-uo**.

   | letters | sound |
   |---------|-------|
   | **bo**  | bwo   |
   | **po**  | pwo   |
   | **mo**  | mwo   |
   | **fo**  | fwo   |
   
   However, these are hard to pronounce in English, and the mispronunciations bow, poe, etc., are so common that they seem to be stuck.

7. The letter **i** is usually pronounced /i/, as in beet. But when it's followed by **i**, it usually ends up short:

   | letters | sound            |
   |---------|------------------|
   | **jin** | djinn (not jean) |
   | **qin** | chin (not cheen) |
   | **xin** | shin (not sheen) |

7a. But in the following cases, it is silent (that is, the consonant becomes syllabic):

   | letters | sound                    |
   |---------|--------------------------|
   | **zhi** | jjj, never jee           |
   | **chi** | chhh, never chee         |
   | **shi** | shhh, never she          |
   | **ri**  | rrr, never ree           |
   | **zi**  | dzzz, never zee          |
   | **ci**  | tsss, never as in tsetse |
   | **si**  | sss, never see           |

8. The letter **u** is usually pronounced /u/, as in boot. 

8a. But in certain combinations, it is actually shorthand:

   | combination | short for | sound            |
   |-------------|-----------|------------------|
   | **-ui**     | **-uei**  | /weɪ/ way        |
   | **-un**     | **-uen**  | /wɛn/ as in Owen |
   | **-iu**     | **-iou**  | /yoʊ/ yo         |

8b. And in **ju qu xu yu**, it is actually shorthand for **ü**.
